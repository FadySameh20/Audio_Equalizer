# Audio_Equalizer
This program uses digital filters to implement an audio equalizer. The equalizer's function is to vary the gain of each specific band as the user prefers.

## Procedures:
1) Develop the frequency band filters in the following bands: (0-170 Hz) - (170-310 Hz) - (310- 600 Hz) - (600-1000 Hz) - (1-3 KHz) - (3-6 KHz) - (6-12 KHz) - (12-14 KHz) - (14-16 KHz)
2) Analyze and export these outputs (magnitude, phase, impulse and step response, order and gain/poles/zeros). 
3) Filter the wave file using the filters developed in step 1.
4) Draw the output signals in Time and frequency domains.
5) Amplify the output signals using the user defined gain.
6) Add the amplified-output signals in time domain to form composite signal.
7) Draw and compare the composite signal with the original signal. (in time and frequency) 
8) Play the output wave signal.
